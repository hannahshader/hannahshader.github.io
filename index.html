		<p>Describe the API you selected and what it does:</p>
        <p>This API returns pictures of cats. Data is returned in a JSON format.</p>
        <p>Cite the website where you found it:</p>
        <p>https://thecatapi.com/</p>
        <p>Describe the options/parameters you used for the API request â€“ i.e., what info did you need to provide (in the query string) to the API to get your results?</p>
        <p>I simply requested a cat image without any parameters/options set, because I wanted to have the most variety in kinds of cat images I could get. However, if I wanted to, I could speicify breed ID, category, or image type.</p>
        <p>Give two applications where this API would be helpful.</p>
        <p>1) It could be used to generate pictures of cats to decorate a personal website for someone passiate about cats. 2) Someone could create a website that generates cat images for stress relief. </p>
        <p>What were the most challenging and most satisfying things about doing this assignment?</p>
        <p>Most challenging was understanding how to use the postman website. Most satifying was seeing the API images load, and be different every time.</p>
